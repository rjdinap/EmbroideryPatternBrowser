## Description
This program was designed with one purpose in mind: Browse and view your existing embroidery files FAST. If you've ever sat there and waited while windows scanned your filesystem looking for files, this is the program you need.
- tens of thousands of files - no problem
- hundreds of thousands of files - no problem
- millions of files - still no problem

## Help file / user instructions
Here's a link to the help file (as a .pdf): https://github.com/rjdinap/EmbroideryPatternBrowser/blob/master/EmbroideryPatternBrowser/Help/EmbroideryHelp.pdf


## I'm too lazy to read the help
 - You'll scan your filesystem one time.
 - File information is stored in a database.
 - And then you can search for files (even with a database containing millions of filename, in < 1 second.)
 - Images are converted from their native embroidery format and shown on the screen in realtime, even if your search returns hundreds of thousands of rows.
 - You can easily copy files to a USB flash drive from inside the program, without having to mess around with opening windows explorer windows
